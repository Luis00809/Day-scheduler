# Day-scheduler

## Descirption 
I created the Day-scheduler to keep track of a daily schedule. The application saves the user's input even when the page is refreshed. If the time-block is before the current hour then the background is green which signifies the future. If the time block is red then it is the same as the current hour which signifies the present. If the time-block is grey then it signigies that it is in the past. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
The day scheduler was created to keep track of anyones daily duties. Anyone that wants to keep track of their daily schedule can use the application.
The day scheduler can be found at: 

Here is a preview of the application: ![day-scheduler-preview](./workday%20scheduler%20sc.png)


## Credits
I didn't know how to compare my id of each time-block to the current hour so I looked up how to using phind.com. I searched how use the parseInt method as well as the .split method to seperate the interger in the id of each timeblock.
